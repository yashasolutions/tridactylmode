# Tridactyl Major Mode for Emacs

A basic emacs major mode for [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) 

## Installation 

You can just put the `tridactyl-mode.el` somewhere in your config and be done with it.

A more structured approach can be, for doom emacs users:

``` emacs-lisp
(package! tridactyl-mode
  :recipe (:fetcher github :repo "yashasolutions/tridactylmode"))
```
